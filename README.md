# SL  — Sign Language Recognition for Video Conferencing

A real-time Sign Language (SL) recognition system built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and LSTM neural networks. Designed to help deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals communicate effectively in video conferencing environments like Google .

---

## Overview

This system recognizes 6 SL gestures commonly used in ing contexts and displays them as on-screen text in real time. A two-layer LSTM model trained on hand landmark sequences achieves **94.44% test accuracy**.

| Gesture     | Meaning              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| ✋ Yes      | Agreement            |
| 🤚 No       | Disagreement         |
| ☝️ Question | I have a question    |
| 🔄 Repeat   | Can you repeat that? |
| 👍 OK       | Understood           |
| 🖐️ Wait     | Please wait          |

## Pipeline

```
Webcam → OpenCV → MediaPipe (21 landmarks × xyz = 63 values)
       → 30-frame sequences → LSTM → Predicted sign + confidence %
```

---

## Tech Stack

- **MediaPipe** — hand landmark detection
- **OpenCV** — webcam feed and UI
- **TensorFlow / Keras** — LSTM model training and inference
- **NumPy** — landmark data storage (`.npy` format)
- **Python 3.12**

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SL-.git
cd SL-

# Create a virtual environment (Python 3.12 recommended)
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install mediapipe tensorflow opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Download the MediaPipe hand landmarker model and place it in the project root:

## Usage

**1. Collect data**

```bash
python collect.py
# Set CURRENT_SIGN = 'yes' (or any sign) in the script
# Press SPACE to start, pauses every 40 clips for next person
```

**2. Train the model**

```bash
python train.py
# Trains LSTM on collected data, saves sl_model.keras
```

**3. Run real-time detection**

```bash
python test.py
# Shows live webcam feed with predicted sign and confidence score
# Press Q to quit
```

## Dataset

Collected via webcam using MediaPipe hand landmark extraction. Each sign has 120 sequences of 30 frames recorded by 3 people to ensure variety.

- Total clips: 720 (120 × 6 signs)
- Features per frame: 63 (21 landmarks × x, y, z)
- Input shape to LSTM: (30, 63)
